# Send me a message on Ethereum Network.

This project demonstrates a basic use case of Blockchain Technology in which you would lear sever things just by sending me a message.

# What is Blockchain?
In simple words, blockchain is a open ledger that is used by every single node to process things in real world. In this ledger, smart contracts are defined so that they are executed automatically when a condition defined in them gets fulfilled. 

# Some key points to understand
1. Based on a defined blockchain there are multiple networks running at a time using same protocol. Also, for each of the network, Testnets are present on which the smart contract could be tested before deploying them on Mainnet.
2. Everything that can perform a transaction, holds an address. Which means Smart Contract, as well as crypto wallets have their own address on blockchain.
3. Everything which has an adrress can send or receive cryptocurrency, which means Smart Contracts can also hold funds with them. ðŸ‘€
4. Gas Price is a processing fee that is paid to miners for helps us to officially write a transaction on the blockchain.

# How can I send a message?
1. Download Metamsk extension for chrome
2. Create your own crypto wallet 
3. Add Polygon Testnet using details mentioned below and use this Testnet
4. Visit https://faucet.polygon.technology/ and past your Wallet's address to get some fake MATIC to pay for gas fees.
5. Click on Connect Wallet
6. Type and share your thoughts with me

# So what happens when you write a message and send it to me on Blockchain.
1. First of all when the webpage loads up, it searchs for a Crypto Wallet linked to Polygon Network to connect with.
2. So when it gets connected, it allways you to see all the previsous transactions (messages) when were mined using that contract.
3. On sending a message, a metamask pop up comes on the screen which asks you to pay a nominal gas fee to mine the transaction on the testnetwork.
4. Wait, it take some time for the minners to collect a bunch of transactions requested by everyone on the network. After which a block gets minned on the Ethereum Testnetwork representing all the transactions which were wrote at once. This Block will never be deleted from the Blockchain as a copy of it was replicated and sent to all the miners (Nodes).
5. Successfully sent messages can be seen on the webpage on a refresh as a method from the smart contract gets called to represet the data it holds.
